# gdxWalkable

It's just jWalkable, but using libGDX and meant to be GWT-friendly!
See [jWalkable's repo](https://github.com/implicit-invocation/jwalkable) for more.

As far as I can tell, no one is currently using this repo. If you do want some sort
of polygonal pathfinding library, you can use this, I guess, but don't expect any
form of support. You could also follow the steps [outlined by the author of the Haxe repo](https://github.com/tommyettinger/gdxWalkable/issues/1)
that jWalkable was based on (and this is based on jWalkable), and compile the Java
code from hxDaedalus yourself using a more recent version. It probably won't use
libGDX properly and won't be GWT-friendly, but it might be! Good luck!
